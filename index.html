                    Moon in Piesces - Moon in Pisces is sensitive and perceptive, which can lead to feelings of insecurity and passivity in life. Pursuing creative or spiritual interests can lead to success as an artist or mystic. However, there may be a tendency towards seduction and an idealized dream of a partner that may lead to disappointment.
                <p>
                    You have the tendency to have habits, and alcohol or drugs may become one of them. But they are only substitutes and you need to figure out what your soul really needs. Instead of searching for ship of dreams you should become a lifeboat.
